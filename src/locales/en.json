      "main": "Hey! First of all, thanks for using this bot!\n\nHave you ever had a moments when you see a trailer of cool movie and give yourself a promise to watch it? Then it appears to be 2 or 3 months until the release of this movie and you simply forget about it..\n\nI was in such situation quite a lot of time. That's why this bot exists. It works quite simply - you can search for a movie you would like to watch later and add it to your collection. After that bot will send you a message once you can watch this movie online. Easy? Of course! Easy and powerful!"
