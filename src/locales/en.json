Then it appears to be 2 or 3 months until the release of this movie and you simply forget about it.. I was in such situation quite a lot of time. That's why this bot exists. It works quite simply - you can search for a movie you would like to watch later and add it to your collection. After that bot will send you a message once you can watch this movie online. Easy? Of course! Easy and powerful!"
